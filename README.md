# css

For the CSS I first created root variables to use throughout my page. 

Created a container to wrap up all the sections and assigned it a grid display.
throughout the sections i assigned a grid display and divided into fractions or grid area. 

Images were given a 100% width to fit container. Throughout the page I stuck with 4 main colors.
