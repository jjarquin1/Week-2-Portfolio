# Week-2-Portfolio
I'm creating a professional portfolio 

# html

Restructure entire HTML document. first created sections for each of my tabs, including my introduction, my skills, my portfolio and my contact information. 
Second I created a slider for all my portfolio section and attached images and added alt tags. 
Third I linked the href links. The menu tabs will take you that sectioin of the page. When you click on the projects it will take you to the live site.
When you click on the github or linkedin tab it will open a new window and direct you to that page. when you clic on the email tab, it will prompt an email to send. The resume tab still needs to be linked, I plan on creating an alert or second html page to display and option to print my resume.

# css

For the CSS I first created root variables to use throughout my page. 

Created a container to wrap up all the sections and assigned it a grid display.
throughout the sections i assigned a grid display and divided into fractions or grid area. 

Images were given a 100% width to fit container. Throughout the page I stuck with 4 main colors.
