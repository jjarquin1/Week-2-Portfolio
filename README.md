# Week-2-Portfolio
I'm creating a professional portfolio 

#html

I started by creating sections and divs to set up my wire frame. 

I gave some of them classes but most of them Id's because there were certain things i wanted to pin point 
before i go to CSS and start styling 

i created a header in which i decided i would put a nav bar. I was having trouble adjusting h1 in the nav bar to my liking so i put it in the
div class .background instead.  

i created 3 sectioins, and for each section i created 3 divs in which i planned to put content.

after those were in place i went forward and put pictures and icons to visualize the content in hand and i added alts to all images in the html 

i linked the nav bar to the correlating ids and also linked anchors in my contact section to the correlating websites. 
the project section also has a link to my single project from the prework model as an example of what i intend to put there in the future. 


#css

I started by listing all classes and ids i intended to make changes too, especially the sections and divs. 

i gave all sectioins a shadowbox and hover effect

all sections are flex responsive, i had trouble aligning some text under the icons  but was able to do so by adding a flex display as inline
and a flex direction of column 

for the responsive elements i noticed the background images where making it awkward for the sections to stack on topo of each other, so i used the 
inspector tool to see where the elements were starting to resopnd awkardlt and decided best to remove the background images at certain pixels. 
i made 3 media querries for this

i am mostly happy with the response but i understand that the background image i used for the body is still giving an awkward response after 400px.
i intend to fix it within the next few days. i will update the read me file with any changes
